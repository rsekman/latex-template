# latex-template
A reasonable quickstart template for a LaTeX document, with a Makefile.

Rename `paper.tex` to something more descriptive, and update the `project` variable in the `Makefile` correspondingly.
The variables `bib` is meant for your `.bib` file.
The `Makefile` variable `figs` lists figures, assumed to be PDFs in a directory `figures/`.
The variable `deps` is a list of all dependencies of your document: bibliography, figures, etc.

By default figures are assumed to be generated by scripts in `python/`, specified by a Makefile in that directory.
Modify the recipe as appropriate for your project.

# Formats

Large packages such as `TiKZ` and `biblatex` can increase compile times significantly.
By precompiling the preamble to a format, much time can be saved.
Unset the `fmt` Makefile variable to *disable* this.

# .tar.gz

The `$(project).tar.gz` should produce a tarball that can be directly uploaded to arXiv.
